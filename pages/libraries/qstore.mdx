JS library for state management based on RxJS. It's a simple and lightweight alternative to Redux, MobX, Vuex, etc. Use it if it fits your needs.

## Install

I closed NPM package - it's so small that you should just copy-paste it to your project.

    ```typescript
    import {BehaviorSubject, Subject, Observable} from 'rxjs';
    import {distinctUntilChanged, map} from 'rxjs/operators';

    // Store
    export abstract class Store<T> {
        private state$: BehaviorSubject<T>;

        protected constructor(initialState: T) {
            this.state$ = new BehaviorSubject(initialState);
        }

        select<K>(mapFn: (state: T) => K): Observable<K> {
            return this.state$.asObservable().pipe(
                map((state: T) => mapFn(state)),
                distinctUntilChanged()
            );
        }

        set(state: Partial<T>): void {
            this.state$.next({...this.values, ...state});
        }

        get values(): T {
            return this.state$.getValue();
        }
    }

    // Actions
    export interface StoreEvent {
        execute: () => void;
        listen: () => Observable<void>;
    }

    export interface StoreEventWithPayload<P> {
        execute: (payload: P) => void;
        listen: () => Observable<P>;
    }

    export const Action = (): StoreEvent => {
        const action$ = new Subject<void>();
        return {
            listen: (): Observable<void> => action$,
            execute: () => action$.next()
        }
    };

    export const ActionWith = <Payload>(): StoreEventWithPayload<Payload> => {
        const payload$ = new Subject<Payload>();
        return {
            listen: (): Observable<Payload> => payload$,
            execute: (payload: Payload) => payload$.next(payload)
        }
    };
