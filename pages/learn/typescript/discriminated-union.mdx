## Problem

We have two types of users: VIP and regular users. VIP users have a `vipCode` property, but regular users don't.

We can sell product to a VIP user with discount based on their `vipCode`, but we can't sell product to a regular user with discount.

Most likely we will have an interface for User with optional `vipCode` property, but it's not a good solution, because we can't use it to distinguish between VIP and regular users.

> TS compiler will yell at you if you try to access `vipCode` property on a regular user. TS doesn't know that you have checked the type of user before accessing `vipCode` property.

```typescript
type User = {
    type: "default" | "VIP";
    id: string;
    vipCode?: string;
};

function buyProduct(productID: string, buyer: User) {
    switch (buyer.type) {
        case "default":
            return sales.order({
                what: productID,
                buyer: buyer.id
            });
        case "VIP":
            return sales.order({
                what: productID,
                buyer: buyer.id,
                vipCode: buyer.vipCode // can be undefined here, so it's an error for the compiler
            });
    }
}
```

## Solution

The solution is to use two types: `User` and `VipUser` - both have only one type - what allows TS to distinguish between them.

It is called **Discriminated Unions** in Typescript.


> Visit docs to learn more at [Discriminated Unions - typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-func.html#discriminated-unions).

```typescript
type User = {
    type: "default";
    id: string;
};

type VipUser = {
    type: "VIP";
    id: string;
    vipCode: string;
};

type Buyer =
    | User
    | VipUser;

function buyProduct(productID: string, buyer: Buyer) {
    switch (buyer.type) {
        case "default":
            return sales.order({
                what: productID,
                buyer: buyer.id
            });
        case "VIP":
            return sales.order({
                what: productID,
                buyer: buyer.id,
                vipCode: buyer.vipCode
            });
    }
}
```

This way we can properly distinguish between VIP and regular users. That's all.
