## Policy

In **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, a **Policy** is a design pattern used to represent a rule or constraint within the domain model. It encapsulates business rules, decisions, or strategies that guide how a certain operation or behavior should be executed. Policies are a way to separate complex business logic, ensuring that rules are both reusable and testable, while keeping the domain model clean and focused.

### Key Characteristics of a Policy:
1. **Encapsulation of Business Rules**: Policies encapsulate specific domain rules that might change over time or vary based on context (e.g., different business units or customer types).
   
2. **Decision-Making Logic**: Policies often represent decision-making logic, answering questions like “Can this action be taken?” or “What is the appropriate behavior in this scenario?”

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Policies separate the concern of enforcing or applying rules from entities or services. This keeps entities focused on representing domain concepts and services on orchestrating workflows.

4. **Composability**: Policies can often be composed to form more complex rules, allowing for flexibility in how business logic is applied.

### Examples of Policies in Domain-Driven Design (TypeScript)

Let’s extend our e-commerce example to include a policy that checks if an order can be placed based on business rules, such as whether the customer has enough credit or the items are in stock.

#### 1. Defining a Simple Policy

We’ll define a **policy** that checks whether a customer can place an order based on their credit limit.

```typescript
class CanPlaceOrderPolicy {
  canPlaceOrder(order: Order, customer: Customer): boolean {
    const totalAmount = order.getTotalAmount();

    // Business rule: The order total cannot exceed the customer's credit limit
    if (totalAmount > customer.getCreditLimit()) {
      return false;
    }

    // Business rule: All items in the order must be in stock
    for (const item of order.getItems()) {
      if (item.getQuantity() > item.getProduct().getStock()) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    return true;
  }
}
```

In this example:
- The `CanPlaceOrderPolicy` encapsulates the logic for determining whether a customer can place an order.
- The policy checks two business rules:
  1. The total order amount must not exceed the customer’s credit limit.
  2. All items must be in stock.

#### 2. Using the Policy

Now, let’s use the policy in the order placement workflow. The policy will be used to decide whether or not the order can be placed.

```typescript
async function placeOrderWithPolicy(
  orderRepository: OrderRepository,
  customer: Customer,
  products: Product[],
  quantities: number[]
): Promise<void> {
  const orderFactory = new OrderFactory();
  const order = orderFactory.createOrder(customer, products, quantities);

  const canPlaceOrderPolicy = new CanPlaceOrderPolicy();

  if (!canPlaceOrderPolicy.canPlaceOrder(order, customer)) {
    console.log(`Order cannot be placed for customer ${customer.customerId}.`);
    return;
  }

  console.log(`Order ${order.orderId} has been successfully placed.`);
  await orderRepository.add(order);
}

// Example usage:
await placeOrderWithPolicy(orderRepository, customer, [product1, product2], [2, 1]);
```

Here:
- The `CanPlaceOrderPolicy` is used to decide if the order can be placed.
- If the policy returns `false`, the workflow is interrupted, preventing the order from being placed.

#### 3. More Complex Policy (Composing Rules)

You can also compose multiple policies to form more complex decision-making logic. Let’s assume we want to add a new rule that checks if the customer has a valid loyalty membership before they can place an order.

We can extend our `CanPlaceOrderPolicy` to include this new rule:

```typescript
class CanPlaceOrderPolicy {
  canPlaceOrder(order: Order, customer: Customer): boolean {
    const totalAmount = order.getTotalAmount();

    // Business rule: The order total cannot exceed the customer's credit limit
    if (totalAmount > customer.getCreditLimit()) {
      return false;
    }

    // Business rule: All items in the order must be in stock
    for (const item of order.getItems()) {
      if (item.getQuantity() > item.getProduct().getStock()) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    // Business rule: Customer must have a valid loyalty membership
    if (!customer.hasValidLoyaltyMembership()) {
      return false;
    }

    return true;
  }
}
```

In this case, the `CanPlaceOrderPolicy` now checks three business rules:
1. The total amount must not exceed the customer’s credit limit.
2. All items must be in stock.
3. The customer must have a valid loyalty membership.

#### 4. Testing Policies

Since policies encapsulate business rules, they are easy to test in isolation. Here’s an example of how you might test the `CanPlaceOrderPolicy`:

```typescript
describe('CanPlaceOrderPolicy', () => {
  it('should not allow placing order if total exceeds credit limit', () => {
    const customer = new Customer('customer123', 'Alice');
    customer.setCreditLimit(100);  // Set credit limit to $100

    const order = new Order('order123', 'customer123', new Date());
    order.addItem(new OrderItem('product1', 2, 60));  // Total amount: $120

    const canPlaceOrderPolicy = new CanPlaceOrderPolicy();
    const canPlaceOrder = canPlaceOrderPolicy.canPlaceOrder(order, customer);

    expect(canPlaceOrder).toBe(false);  // Credit limit exceeded
  });

  it('should allow placing order if all rules are satisfied', () => {
    const customer = new Customer('customer123', 'Bob');
    customer.setCreditLimit(500);  // Set credit limit to $500

    const order = new Order('order456', 'customer123', new Date());
    order.addItem(new OrderItem('product1', 3, 100));  // Total amount: $300

    const canPlaceOrderPolicy = new CanPlaceOrderPolicy();
    const canPlaceOrder = canPlaceOrderPolicy.canPlaceOrder(order, customer);

    expect(canPlaceOrder).toBe(true);  // All rules satisfied
  });
});
```

### Policy Composition

In more complex systems, you might want to compose multiple policies to represent different aspects of the decision-making process. In TypeScript, this could be achieved by chaining or combining policies.

```typescript
class AndPolicy<T> {
  private policies: Policy<T>[];

  constructor(...policies: Policy<T>[]) {
    this.policies = policies;
  }

  isSatisfiedBy(candidate: T): boolean {
    return this.policies.every(policy => policy.isSatisfiedBy(candidate));
  }
}

class CustomerHasEnoughCreditPolicy implements Policy<Order> {
  isSatisfiedBy(order: Order, customer: Customer): boolean {
    return order.getTotalAmount() <= customer.getCreditLimit();
  }
}

class ItemsInStockPolicy implements Policy<Order> {
  isSatisfiedBy(order: Order): boolean {
    return order.getItems().every(item => item.getQuantity() <= item.getProduct().getStock());
  }
}

// Composing multiple policies
const policy = new AndPolicy(
  new CustomerHasEnoughCreditPolicy(),
  new ItemsInStockPolicy()
);

const canPlaceOrder = policy.isSatisfiedBy(order, customer);
```

This allows for a flexible and modular way to define and apply business rules.

### Benefits of Policies in DDD

1. **Flexibility**: Policies can easily be swapped, updated, or composed to meet evolving business rules.
   
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Policies separate rule-based logic from entities and services, ensuring that domain models stay focused on representing data and behavior.

3. **Testability**: Since policies encapsulate specific business rules, they are easy to unit test in isolation.

4. **Reusability**: Policies are reusable components that can be applied across multiple services or domain models, promoting consistency in rule enforcement.

5. **Consistency**: Using policies ensures that business rules are applied consistently throughout the application, reducing the risk of inconsistent rule enforcement.

### Conclusion

In **Domain-Driven Design**, a **Policy** is a way to encapsulate business rules and decision-making logic, keeping domain entities clean and focused on core behaviors. Policies handle logic that spans multiple entities or aggregates, or that involves business rules that may change over time.
