# DDD Modules

## Module

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) `modules` are used to organize domain elements like entities, value objects, etc. and business logic.

**Modules:**
- are responsible for communication between teams and any externaly connected companies, it should follow direction of `Ubiquitous Language` creation.

- helps with easier understanding of the domain model. Each module is focused on a specific part of the domain, it allows effective cooperation and easy to understand messaging.

- splits responsibilities, each team can work independently, so system is not going to be toxicated by any suprising line, added by someone because of any shi*.
  
Below is an example folder structure for modules such as `payments`, `shipment`, `factory`, and `availability`:

> Module can be a separate App, you can introduce CQRS to split reads, etc. sky is the limit
```text copy
/app
    /availability
    /factory
    /payments
    /shipment
```

### Examples

- **Payments**: The module responsible for managing payments. It contains entities, services, repositories, and controllers related to payment processing.
- **Shipment**: The module handling shipments and logistics. It includes business logic, entities, and services related to managing the delivery process.
- **Factory**: The module representing the management of a factory, production, or a manufacturing facility. It includes entities and services associated with the factory.
- **Availability**: The module focused on checking the availability of products or resources. It contains logic for checking stock levels and availability.

Each module is separate and independent, which simplifies managing business logic, testing, and extending the system.
