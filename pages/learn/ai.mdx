<p className="text-gray-500">AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.</p>
<p className="text-gray-500">The primary goal of AI is to create systems that can function intelligently and independently. AI is a broad field that encompasses everything from simple calculators to self-driving cars to systems that can diagnose diseases.</p>
<p className="text-gray-500">AI is a rapidly evolving field that is constantly changing and growing. As technology advances, so too does the field of AI. New breakthroughs and discoveries are made all the time, and the possibilities for AI are virtually limitless.</p>
