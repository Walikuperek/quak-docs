# Running a basic test server

## Before you begin

Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project.

Enable the `Compute Engine` API.

## Create Linux VM instance

<Steps>

### Create a VM instance

In the Google Cloud console, go to the `Create an instance` page.

### Select operating system

In the `Boot disk` section, click `Change` to begin configuring your boot disk.

On the Public images tab, choose `Ubuntu` from the Operating system list.

Choose `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` from the Version list.

Click `Select`.

### Firewall

In the Firewall section, select `Allow HTTP` traffic.

### Create

To create the VM, click `Create`.
</Steps>

Allow a short period of time for the instance to start. After the instance is ready, it's listed on the VM instances page with a green status icon.

## Connect to the VM instance
<Steps>
### Choose VM instance

In the  VM instances page choose your instance.

### Connect via SSH

In the list of virtual machine instances, click `SSH` in the row of the instance that you want to connect to.
</Steps>

## Install Apache
<Steps>
### Install packages

To update the available packages and install the apache2 package, use the system package manager for that operating system. To update an Ubuntu VM, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install apache2
```

### Start server

After installing Apache, the operating system automatically starts the Apache server.

### Verify that Apache is running

To verify that Apache is running run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

### Prepare for browser testing

Overwrite the Apache web server default web page:

```bash
echo '<!doctype html><html><body><h1>QUAK Hello!</h1></body></html>' | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
```

</Steps>

## Test your server

Test that your VM is serving traffic on its external IP address.

<Steps>
### Choose VM instance

In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.

Copy the `external IP` for your VM under the External IP column.

### Open browser

In a browser, navigate to `http://[EXTERNAL-IP]`. Don't connect using https because this causes the server to return a `Connection Refused` error.

### Result

You should now see the page with the following text:
```
QUAK Hello!
```

</Steps>
